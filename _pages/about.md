<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a Ph.D. student at [the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (Ê∏ÖÂçéÂ§ßÂ≠¶ËÆ°ÁÆóÊú∫ÁßëÂ≠¶‰∏éÊäÄÊúØÁ≥ª), advised by [Song-Hai Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1117/3538.htm) (Âº†ÊùæÊµ∑).
Before that, I achieved my bachelor's degree at [the School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing](https://scce.ustb.edu.cn/) (Âåó‰∫¨ÁßëÊäÄÂ§ßÂ≠¶ËÆ°ÁÆóÊú∫‰∏éÈÄö‰ø°Â∑•Á®ãÂ≠¶Èô¢).

My research interest focuses on <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">digital humans</span> and <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">computer vision</span>, including digital body/head avatar creation/editing, image/video generative models, and novel 3D representations. 

Now, I am in the fourth year of my five-year Ph.D. career and <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">will be graduating in June of 2025</span>. If you're looking for a digital human researcher, feel free to contact me (wangcong20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn). BTW, the workplace is preferably in Beijing or somewhere around.
