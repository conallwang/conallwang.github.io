<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a Ph.D. student at [the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (Ê∏ÖÂçéÂ§ßÂ≠¶ËÆ°ÁÆóÊú∫ÁßëÂ≠¶‰∏éÊäÄÊúØÁ≥ª), advised by [Song-Hai Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1117/3538.htm) (Âº†ÊùæÊµ∑).
Before that, I achieved my bachelor's degree at [the School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing](https://scce.ustb.edu.cn/) (Âåó‰∫¨ÁßëÊäÄÂ§ßÂ≠¶ËÆ°ÁÆóÊú∫‰∏éÈÄö‰ø°Â∑•Á®ãÂ≠¶Èô¢). During my PhD study, I had interned in Tencent AI Lab for two years, focusing on 3D digital human/head reconstruction/editing related researches, supervised by [Di Kang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2ztThPwAAAAJ&hl=en). Now, I'm interned in the Ant Research Institute of Ant Group and still focuses on 3D digital human/head reconstruction/editing/generation, supervised by [Xuan Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h-3xd3EAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

My research interest focuses on <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">digital humans</span> and <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">computer vision</span>, including digital body/head avatar creation/editing, image/video generative models, and novel 3D representations. 

Now, I am in the fourth year of my five-year Ph.D. career and <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">will be graduating in June of 2025</span>. If you're looking for a digital human researcher, feel free to contact me (wangcong20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).

[MeGA: Hybrid Mesh-Gaussian Head Avatar for High-Fidelity Rendering and Head Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19026)

**Cong Wang**, Di Kang, He-Yi Sun, Shen-Han Qian, Zi-Xuan Wang, Linchao Bao, Song-Hai Zhang

[**Project**](https://conallwang.github.io/MeGA_Pages/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='0gSn6sgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC'></span></strong>
- By proposing the use of **more appropriate representations for different parts of the human head** and the corresponding **hybrid rendering methods**, we produce **high-quality** 3D human head avatar, and for the first time, **support human head editing** (i.e., texture editing and hair alteration).

[Neural Point-based Volumetric Avatar: Surface-guided Neural Points for Efficient and Photorealistic Volumetric Head Avatar](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3610548.3618204)

**Cong Wang**, Di Kang, Yan-Pei Cao, Linchao Bao, Ying Shan, Song-Hai Zhang

[**Project**](https://conallwang.github.io/npva.github.io/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='0gSn6sgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC'></span></strong>
- We propose a new **surface-guided neural point representation** and the corresponding **rendering acceleration method** to greatly improve the rendering quality of **eyes and mouth interiors** in 3D digital human head modeling.

[LoLep: Single-View View Synthesis with Locally-Learned Planes and Self-Attention Occlusion Inference](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Wang_LoLep_Single-View_View_Synthesis_with_Locally-Learned_Planes_and_Self-Attention_Occlusion_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf)

**Cong Wang**, Yu-Ping Wang, Dinesh Manocha

[**Project**](None) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='0gSn6sgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC'></span></strong>
- We propose to use **an NN Sampler** for **more certain and reasonable MPI plane locations** and introduce a reprojection loss to facilitate sampler learning. Additionally, we propose **the block self-attention mechanism** to enhance the network's inference ability for the occluded regions.

[**Project**](https://github.com/conallwang/MotionHint) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='0gSn6sgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C'></span></strong>
- We introduce **the motion prior** of camera carriers (mainly unmanned vehicles) via **a pre-trained PPNet**, so that the predicted camera poses can be corrected according to the motion prior, yielding the state of art results.
